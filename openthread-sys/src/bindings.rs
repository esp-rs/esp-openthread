#[doc = " Pointer type defines the callback used by SRP client to notify user of changes/events/errors.\n\n This callback is invoked on a successful registration of an update (i.e., add/remove of host-info and/or some\n service(s)) with the SRP server, or if there is a failure or error (e.g., server rejects a update request or client\n times out waiting for response, etc).\n\n In case of a successful reregistration of an update, `aError` parameter would be `OT_ERROR_NONE` and the host info\n and the full list of services is provided as input parameters to the callback. Note that host info and services each\n track its own state in the corresponding `mState` member variable of the related data structure (the state\n indicating whether the host-info/service is registered or removed or still being added/removed, etc).\n\n The list of removed services is passed as its own linked-list `aRemovedServices` in the callback. Note that when the\n callback is invoked, the SRP client (OpenThread implementation) is done with the removed service instances listed in\n `aRemovedServices` and no longer tracks/stores them (i.e., if from the callback we call `otSrpClientGetServices()`\n the removed services will not be present in the returned list). Providing a separate list of removed services in\n the callback helps indicate to user which items are now removed and allow user to re-claim/reuse the instances.\n\n If the server rejects an SRP update request, the DNS response code (RFC 2136) is mapped to the following errors:\n\n  - (0)  NOERROR   Success (no error condition)                    -> OT_ERROR_NONE\n  - (1)  FORMERR   Server unable to interpret due to format error  -> OT_ERROR_PARSE\n  - (2)  SERVFAIL  Server encountered an internal failure          -> OT_ERROR_FAILED\n  - (3)  NXDOMAIN  Name that ought to exist, does not exist        -> OT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND\n  - (4)  NOTIMP    Server does not support the query type (OpCode) -> OT_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED\n  - (5)  REFUSED   Server refused for policy/security reasons      -> OT_ERROR_SECURITY\n  - (6)  YXDOMAIN  Some name that ought not to exist, does exist   -> OT_ERROR_DUPLICATED\n  - (7)  YXRRSET   Some RRset that ought not to exist, does exist  -> OT_ERROR_DUPLICATED\n  - (8)  NXRRSET   Some RRset that ought to exist, does not exist  -> OT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND\n  - (9)  NOTAUTH   Service is not authoritative for zone           -> OT_ERROR_SECURITY\n  - (10) NOTZONE   A name is not in the zone                       -> OT_ERROR_PARSE\n  - (20) BADNAME   Bad name                                        -> OT_ERROR_PARSE\n  - (21) BADALG    Bad algorithm                                   -> OT_ERROR_SECURITY\n  - (22) BADTRUN   Bad truncation                                  -> OT_ERROR_PARSE\n  - Other response codes                                           -> OT_ERROR_FAILED\n\n The following errors are also possible:\n\n  - OT_ERROR_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT : Timed out waiting for response from server (client would continue to retry).\n  - OT_ERROR_INVALID_ARGS     : The provided service structure is invalid (e.g., bad service name or `otDnsTxtEntry`).\n  - OT_ERROR_NO_BUFS          : Insufficient buffer to prepare or send the update message.\n\n Note that in case of any failure, the client continues the operation, i.e. it prepares and (re)transmits the SRP\n update message to the server, after some wait interval. The retry wait interval starts from the minimum value and\n is increased by the growth factor every failure up to the max value (please see configuration parameter\n `OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_SRP_CLIENT_MIN_RETRY_WAIT_INTERVAL` and the related ones for more details).\n\n @param[in] aError            The error (see above).\n @param[in] aHostInfo         A pointer to host info.\n @param[in] aServices         The head of linked-list containing all services (excluding the ones removed).
