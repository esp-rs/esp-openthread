/// Create a new OpenThread driver for `embassy-net`, by internally instantiating the `openthread` API types
/// and combining them with the `embassy-net-driver-channel` runner types.
///
/// The driver is communicating with `embassy-net` and `smoltcp` using naked Ipv6 frames, without
/// any hardware address and any additional framing (like e.g. Ethernet) attached.
///
/// All details about the network stack (i.e. that it is based on IEEE 802.15.4) are abstracted away and
/// invisible to `embassy-net` and `smoltcp`.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `ot`: The OpenThread instance.
/// - `state`: A mutable reference to the `embassy-net-driver-channel` state resources.
///
/// Returns:
///   - The `embassy-net-driver-channel` state runner (note: this is not really a "runner" per se, but more of a controller to switch on/off the Driver)
///   - A runner that runs both the `openthread` stack as well as the `embassy-net` driver stack
///   - The `embassy-net` Driver for OpenThread
