Platform-agnostic, async Rust bindings for the [`OpenThread`](https://openthread.io/) library.

Tailored for Rust embedded baremetal.

For certain MCUs / Rust targets, the OpenThread libraries are pre-compiled for convenience.
Current list:
- `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` (ESP32C6 and ESP32H2)
- `riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf`
- `thumbv6m-none-eabi` - WIP - for NRF52

For targets where pre-compiled libs are not available yet (including for the Host itself), a standard `build.rs` build is also supported.
For the on-the-fly OpenThread CMake build to work, you'll need to install and set in your `$PATH`:
- The GCC toolchain correspponding to your Rust target, with working `foo-bar-gcc -print-sysroot` command
- Recent Clang
- cmake amd ninja

## Features

- MTD functionality
- Integration with `embassy-net` and `edge-nal`
- Out of the box support for ESP32C6 and ESP32H2, with pre-compiled binaries and the IEEE 802.15.4 radio provided by the `esp-hal` project

## Next

- Out of the box support for NRF52, with pre-compiled binaries and the IEEE 802.15.4 radio provided by the `embassy-nrf` project
- Sleepy end-device
- FTD functionality

## Non-Goals

- BR functionality

## Status

The examples (native OpenThread UDP sockets; `embassy-net` integration; SRP) build and run on Espressif MCUs.
The code is not completely tested yet though.

## Testing

Build and flash the [OT-CLI](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/openthread/ot_cli) on ESP32C6 or ESP32H2.

```

Flash the example to an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2 - use a feature for choosing the build-target.

It should output something like
```

fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc
```

Please note the link-local address. (fe80::...)

Back in the OT-CLI ping the device (using the address from above)
```
> ping fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc

16 bytes from fe80:0:0:0:906d:1cce:1bc9:8d07: icmp_seq=15 hlim=64 time=13ms
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/avg/max = 13/13.0/13 ms.
Done
```

Now send and receive a UDP message (using the address from above)
```
> udp open

Done
> udp bind :: 1212

Done
> udp send fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc 1212 Hello

Done
5 bytes from fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc 1212 Hello
```

So it connected and you can successfully ping the device. Receiving and sending UDP packets also works. ðŸŽ‰
