# [WIP] openthread

Platform-agnostic, async Rust bindings for the [`OpenThread`](https://openthread.io/) library.

Tailored for Rust embedded baremetal, with out of the box support for [`embassy-net`](https://crates.io/crates/embassy-net).

For certain MCUs, the OpenThread libraries are pre-compiled for convenience.
Look at the `openthread-sys` crate for more information (TBD)

## Goals

- MTD functionality

## Later goals

- Sleepy end-device
- FTD functionality

## Non-Goals

- BR functionality

## Status

The code ONLY type-checks, but is not tested yet (pending).

## Testing

Build and flash the [OT-CLI](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/openthread/ot_cli) on ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2.

```

Flash the example to an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2 - use a feature for choosing the build-target.

It should output something like
```
Initializing

fdde:ad00:beef:0:f9ee:5d6d:7fe6:daab
fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc
```

Please note the link-local address. (fe80::...)

Back in the OT-CLI ping the device (using the address from above)
```
> ping fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc

16 bytes from fe80:0:0:0:906d:1cce:1bc9:8d07: icmp_seq=15 hlim=64 time=13ms
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/avg/max = 13/13.0/13 ms.
Done
```

Now send and receive a UDP message (using the address from above)
```
> udp open

Done
> udp bind :: 1212

Done
> udp send fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc 1212 Hello

Done
5 bytes from fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc 1212 Hello
```

So it connected and you can successfully ping the device. Receiving and sending UDP packets also works. ðŸŽ‰
