Platform-agnostic, async Rust bindings for the [`OpenThread`](https://openthread.io/) library.

Tailored for Rust embedded baremetal.

The [crate](openthread) does not depend on any platform features and only needs an implementation of a single trait - [`Radio`](openthread/src/radio.rs) - that represents the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY radio. 
The radio might be located on the same die, or the user might provide an implementation that communicates with the actual radio over UART, SPI, USB, etc.

Two IEEE 802.15.4 radios are supported out of the box:
- The ESP32C6 and ESP32H2 radio (enable the `esp-ieee802154` feature; see [examples](examples/esp));
- The NRF radio (enable the `embasy-nrf` feature; see [examples](examples/nrf)).

## Build

For certain MCUs / Rust targets, the OpenThread libraries are pre-compiled for convenience.
Current list (might be extended upon request):
- `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` (ESP32C6 and ESP32H2)
- `thumbv7em-none-eabi` (NRF52)

**For these targets you only need `rustc`/`cargo` as usual!**

Small caveat: since `openthread` does a few calls into the C standard library (primarily `str*` functions), at link time, it is up to the user to poly-fill the `str*` syscalls - [either with the MCU ROM functions](examples/esp/.cargo/config.toml), or by [depending](examples/nrf/Cargo.toml) on [`tinyrlibc`](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/tinyrlibc), or with both.

### Build for other targets / custom build

For targets where pre-compiled libs are not available (including for the Host itself), a standard `build.rs` build is also supported.
For the on-the-fly OpenThread CMake build to work, you'll need to install and set in your `$PATH`:
- The GCC toolchain correspponding to your Rust target, with **working** `foo-bar-gcc -print-sysroot` command
- Recent Clang (for Espressif `xtensa`, [it must be the Espressif fork](https://crates.io/crates/espup), but for all other chips, the stock Clang would work)
- CMake and Ninja

As per above, since `openthread` does a few calls into the C standard library (primarily `str*` functions), the GCC toolchain needs to have the `newlib` (or other libc headers for e.g. non-embedded scenarios) in its sysroot, which is usually the case anyway. `newlib` however is only used _at compile-time_ on baremetal targets (for a few libc headers) and not linked-in.

Examples of GCC toolchains that are known to work fine:
- For ARM (Cortex M CPUs and others) - the [ARM GNU toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain);
  - Note that the Ubuntu `arm-none-eabi-gcc` system package does **NOT** work, as it does not print a sysroot, i.e. `arm-none-eabi-gcc -print-sysroot` returns an empty response, and furthermore, the `newlib` headers are installed in a separate location from the arch headers;
- For RISCV - the [Espressif RISCV toolchain](https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG/releases). The ["official" RISCV GNU toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) should also work;
- For xtensa (Espressif ESP32 and ESP32SXX MCUs) - the [Espressif xtensa toolchain](https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG/releases);
- For the Host machine (non-embedded) - your pre-installed toolchain would work just fine.

## Features

- MTD (Minimal Thread Device) functionality
- Optional integration with [`embassy-net`]() and [`edge-nal`]()
- Out of the box support for the IEEE 802.15.4 radio in [Espressif](openthread/src/esp.rs) and [Nordic Semiconductor](openthread/src/nrf.rs) chips

## Next

- Sleepy end-device
- FTD (Full Thread Device) functionality

## Non-Goals

- Thread Border Router functionality

## Status

The examples (native OpenThread UDP sockets; `embassy-net` integration; SRP) build and run on Espressif MCUs, with testing for NRF pending.
The SRP code is not completely tested yet though.

## Testing

Build and flash the [OT-CLI](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/openthread/ot_cli) on ESP32C6 or ESP32H2.

Flash the example to an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2 - use a feature for choosing the build-target.

It should output something like
```

```

Please note the link-local address. (fe80::...)

Back in the OT-CLI ping the device (using the address from above)
```
> ping fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc

16 bytes from fe80:0:0:0:906d:1cce:1bc9:8d07: icmp_seq=15 hlim=64 time=13ms
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/avg/max = 13/13.0/13 ms.
Done
```

Now send and receive a UDP message (using the address from above)
```
> udp open

Done
> udp bind :: 1212

Done
> udp send fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc 1212 Hello

Done
5 bytes from fe80::6cec:6ace:f5ff:30bc 1212 Hello
```

So it connected and you can successfully ping the device. Receiving and sending UDP packets also works. ðŸŽ‰
